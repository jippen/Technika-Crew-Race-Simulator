    This is a fairly straightforward PHP script for scraping DJ MAX Technika 
US's site for crewrace information, and presenting it in a simple to navigate
list, which should match the lineup available on the actual machine.

    It does require a few extra installation steps to function, which are given 
in the INSTALL file, so be sure to check that before complaining that the script
does not work.

    It is known that the race table is incomplate, and the stylesheet is empty.
I may go back and fix these, but community contributions are more than welcome.
